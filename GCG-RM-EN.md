# Good Corporate Governance & Risk Management
### Background
>  The lack of understanding about good corporate governance in Indonesia makes the Good Corporate Governance aspect look inferior. Despite the fact that GCG plays an important role in the management of company resources, it is expected that business processes can be efficient, effective, economical and productive by always orienting towards company goals and paying attention to stakeholder approach.
> Furthermore, the implementation of GCG, both in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the private sector, is a formidable arsenal not only to fight and minimise corruption, but also to ward off crises and strengthen national economic resilience.
#### GCG implementation has an important role in managing the company, these roles covers:
> 1. Maximizes corporate value through increasing the principles of openness, accountability, responsibility, and fairness so that the company has strong competitiveness both nationally and internationally;
> 2. Encourage the management of the company in a professional, transparent and efficient manner;
> 3. Encouraging the Company's organs in making decisions and carrying out actions based on high moral values and compliance with applicable laws and regulations and taking into account the interests of other stakeholders;
> 4. Increase the Company's contribution to the national economy; and
> 5. Improving the Company's image that is getting better.

## GCG Assesment Service
> To understand the extent to which the company implements GCG, a Good Corporate Governance Assessment can be carried out periodically (every financial year).
> In the assessment process, there is scoring, which evaluates the aspects that should be implemented by a company which becomes the assessment parameter.
> Therefore, through the assessment, it is expected to be able to produce a map of GCG practices in the Company, which can be compared from time to time so that it can be seen what has or has not been done.
> Thus, practices that are in line with GCG are improved, while weaknesses that occur are immediately corrected so that the implementation of GCG can become the foundation of the company's operations.
> With the implementation of GCG, the management of company resources is expected to be efficient, effective, economical and productive by always orienting towards company goals and paying attention to the stakeholder approach.
> In addition, the implementation of GCG, both in state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) and the private sector, is a powerful weapon not only to fight corruption, but also to ward off crises and strengthen national economic resilience.
